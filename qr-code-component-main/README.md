## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To fix problem with flex item overflowing past the top edge and getting cut off with no accessible way to scroll up to see the rest of the content, I removed `align-item:center` and `justify-content:center` from `body`:

```css
body {
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

and replaced it with `margin:auto` instead. The `auto` margins will assume the leftover space, centering item where there's leftover space, and switching to normal alignment when there's not.

```css
.container {
  margin: auto;
}
```

This was also my first experience using Figma. A fun learning process into the design tool and how to translate it into a live product.
